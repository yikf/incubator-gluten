/**
 * This rule is similar with `EnsureRequirements` but only handle local `SortExec`.
 *
 * The reason is that, during transform SparkPlan to GlutenPlan, some operators do not need local
 * sort anymore, e.g., convert SortAggregate to HashAggregateTransformer, and we remove local sort
 * eagerly. However, it may break the other operator's requirements, e.g., A SortMergeJoin on top of
 * SortAggregate with the same key. So, this rule adds local sort back if necessary.
