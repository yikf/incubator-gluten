/**
 * Physical plan rule that derives Velox required subfields for map columns read by a native Parquet
 * scan, so that the reader prunes map entries the query never accesses.
 *
 * Background. Parquet stores a map as a repeated `key_value` group: one key column chunk and one
 * value column chunk per row group, covering every entry of every row. Evaluating `m['k1']` on the
 * scan output therefore decodes all entries into a MapVector, although only one key is needed.
 * Velox's Hive connector lets a `HiveColumnHandle` declare required subfields, written in Velox
 * `Subfield` syntax such as `m["k1"].f1`; `makeScanSpec` turns the map keys they name into a key
 * filter on the map's key stream, so the SelectiveMapColumnReader materializes only matching
 * entries. Struct fields not covered by any required subfield are filled with nulls.
 *
 * Velox treats the declared set as complete and returns null for anything outside it, so the
 * declared paths must cover every read of the column. The rule therefore only handles one plan
 * shape, in which that is easy to show:
 * {{{
 *   Scan [id, m]                              filters: m["a"].s = 'v3'
 *     -> Filter*                              more predicates over keyed paths
 *     -> Project*                             keyed paths under aliases; m may be forwarded
 *     -> Generate*                            m forwarded only if still needed above
 *     -> a Project (or Generate) that no longer outputs m   end of the chain
 * }}}
 * Once a Project drops the attribute (and every alias that still carries map data of it), no
 * operator above can reference it: in a resolved plan an attribute can only be referenced if some
 * child outputs it. Whatever sits above the chain is therefore irrelevant and needs no analysis.
 * Aliases of keyed paths that leave the chain (`m['a'].t AS x`) are fine as well: their value
 * depends only on entries the declared paths keep.
 *
 * Supported, that is, pruned:
 *   - filters on constant-key lookups, `m['a'].s = 'v3'`, `m[1].t > 0`, `element_at(m, 'a')`,
 *     including the `isnotnull(m)` Spark infers next to them. Such a filter reaches Velox as the
 *     scan's remaining filter, whose subfields Velox adds to the declaration; the Velox backend
 *     emits both lookups as the pushdown-capable `get_map_value`, so they contribute `m["a"]`
 *     rather than the bare column (see VeloxSparkPlanExecApi.genElementAtTransformer);
 *   - keyed values projected or aggregated, `SELECT m['a'].t`, `sum(m['a'].t)`, also under a
 *     `count(*)`, a `LIMIT`, an `ORDER BY ... LIMIT`, a `UNION ALL` of such projections, a write of
 *     such values, a UDF or script transformation applied to them, or a join whose sides only read
 *     keyed values below the shuffle: in all of these Spark or Gluten places the keyed access in a
 *     Project that drops the map before anything else sees it;
 *   - maps nested in structs, `c.m['a']`, including the `c.m AS _extract_m` alias Spark's
 *     NestedColumnAliasing inserts; sibling struct fields are declared alongside;
 *   - generators over a keyed value, `explode(m['a'])`: Gluten's pre-projection computes the lookup
 *     below the Generate, and the Generate forwards the map only while an operator above still
 *     needs it, so the chain may end at the Generate itself;
 *   - window partition keys, `OVER (PARTITION BY m['a'])`, which Spark's analyzer extracts into a
 *     Project below the Window's shuffle;
 *   - null checks on keyed paths, `m['a'] IS NULL`.
 *
 * Not supported, that is, the map is read whole:
 *   - the map itself, or an alias still holding it, reaching an exchange, a join, an aggregate, a
 *     union, a write, a UDTF, the fragment's output or any other operator that is not a chain node;
 *     this includes `ORDER BY m['a']`, whose pre-projection must forward the map through the
 *     shuffle because the Sort still outputs it;
 *   - whole-map uses anywhere on the chain, `size(m)`, `map_keys(m)`, `explode(m)`, `m[key_col]`;
 *   - key types without a Velox subscript form, such as date or decimal, and string keys whose
 *     bytes are not valid UTF-8.
 *
 * A chain ends at the first operator that is not a chain node, an exchange included, so a scan's
 * declaration depends only on the operators between it and that point. Structurally identical
 * exchange subtrees therefore always receive identical declarations, and exchange reuse is
 * unaffected.
 *
 * Example. For
 * {{{
 *   SELECT sum(m['a'].t) FROM t WHERE m['a'].s = 'v3'
 * }}}
 * Spark places `m['a'].t AS _extract_t` in a Project below the aggregate, so the chain is Scan ->
 * Filter -> Project and the declared paths are `m["a"].s` and `m["a"].t` (shown in Velox Subfield
 * syntax, which SubfieldPath.toString renders; the wire format is structural, one element per step,
 * see RequiredSubfieldsExtension.proto).
